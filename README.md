# NEURO RAD AI

This project is a web application created to detect tumors on brain MRI images. The BraTS2020 dataset was used here. This dataset consists of 3D (multi-slice) images and the UNet3D architecture was used accordingly for the segmentation process.

The UNET3D architecture is given below:

Thanks to this architecture, we can easily perform segmentation on multi-slice images and as we can see in the interface of our application below, we can segment the size of tumors on each section while navigating between sections with the slider.
